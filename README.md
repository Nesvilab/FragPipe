# FragPipe
FragPipe is a Java Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a suite of computational tools enabling comprehensive analysis of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. It is powered by [MSFragger](https://msfragger.nesvilab.org/) - an ultrafast proteomic search engine suitable for both conventional and "open" (wide precursor mass tolerance) peptide identification. FragPipe also includes [Philosopher](https://nesvilab.github.io/philosopher/) toolkit for downstream post-processing of MSFragger search results (PeptideProphet, iProphet, ProteinProphet), FDR filtering, label-free quantification, and multi-experiment summary report generation. Also included in FragPipe binary are SpectraST-based spectral library building module, and DIA-Umpire SE module for direct analysis of data independent acquisition (DIA) data. 

## Download
Download precompiled binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/Nesvilab/FragPipe/releases/) section of this repository.
The latest release is FragPipe v. 9 (released Feabrurary 22, 2019). 

You will need to download MSFragger separately as described on the [MSFragger website](https://msfragger.nesvilab.org/).

## Documentation
We are currently working on creating Tutorials for most commonly used workflows supported in FragPipe.

For documentation on MSFragger (hardware requirements, search parameters, etc.), see MSFragger [Documentation Wiki page](https://github.com/Nesvilab/MSFragger/wiki).  

For documentation on Philosopher see [Philosopher page](http://philosopher.nesvilab.org/).  

## Questions and Technical Support
Please post all questions/bug reports regarding FragPipe on the [FragPipe GitHub page](https://github.com/Nesvilab/FragPipe).
For questions more specific to various individual components of FragPipe you can also use [MSFragger GitHub page](https://github.com/Nesvilab/MSFragger) and [Philosopher page](https://github.com/Nesvilab/philosopher).

## Running
- on **Windows** use one of the following:
  - Run the Windows executable (*.exe*)
  - `start javaw -jar FragPipe.jar`
  - `java -jar FragPipe.jar`
- **Linux/MacOS**
  - Run the shell script included in the release zip file
  - `java -jar FragPipe.jar`


## Citing the work
Please refer to the following paper:  
[Andy Kong, Felipe Leprevost, Dmitry Avtonomov, Dattatreya Mellacheruvu, Alexey Nesvizhskii. "MSFragger: ultrafast and comprehensive peptide identification in mass spectrometry-based proteomics". Nat Meth, May 2017. DOI: 10.1038/nmeth.4256](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4256)

## Build

### Updating build version
The version of the build is stored in 2 separate places:
 - File: `MSFragger-GUI/src/umich/msfragger/gui/Bundle.properties`  
   Property: `msfragger.gui.version`

 - File: `MSFragger-GUI/build.gradle`  
   Property: `version`


### Building with Gradle (preferred)
You don't need to have Gradle installed. This method uses Gradle Wrapper,
which is included in this repository. Eeverything needed for the build will 
be downloaded.

- To get the jar with all dependencies included, from the directory with 
the `gradle.build` file:  
  `./gradlew clean shadowJar`

- If you're on Windows you can also build a Windows binary (*requires [launch4j](http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/) installed*):  
  `./gradlew clean createAllExecutables`

- To create a zip file with the jar and startup scripts/bat files:  
  `./gradlew distZip`

Inspect the output in `MSFragger-GUI/build/lbis` and 
  `MSFragger-GUI/build/distributions` folders.



### Building with NetBeans (Ant build, deprecated)
**Deprecated:** Use Gradle build instead.  
Open the source project in NetBeans and do "Clean Build". You will get the jar in ./dist directory and a zip file with the current version in the file name and start scripts bundled.
