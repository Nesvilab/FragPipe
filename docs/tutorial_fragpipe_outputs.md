### Guide to FragPipe results

Output files will depend on the [workflow](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/docs/tutorial_fragpipe_workflows.html) used and how experiments/groups are set on the 'Workflow' tab. This page lists the different output files generated by FragPipe. Main report files are either comma-separated (csv) or tab-separated (tsv), and their column contents are described here. Outputs that take the name of the input LC-MS file are shown with the generic 'filename' placeholder here.

Log files are saved automatically (with a timestamp) if an analysis finishes successfully, but they can also be exported (with the 'Export Log' button on the 'Run' tab) to help with troubleshooting if an analysis fails.

FragPipe also uses various configuration and intermediate files listed here.

Also see our [guide to using FragPipe](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/docs/tutorial_fragpipe.html).

#### PTM-Shepherd reports
PTM-Shepherd reports on modification profiles and diagnostic ions (if enabled) are found in the 'ptm-shepherd-output' folder. If glycan assignment is used, PTM-Shepherd will write assigned glycan information directly to the psm.tsv table.

#### TMT/iTRAQ reports
Isobaric labeling reports are found in the 'tmt-report' folder, generated by [TMT-Integrator](https://tmt-integrator.nesvilab.org/). Two sets of isobaric labeling quantification reports are generated, one set with abundances and one with ratios. Files containing 'ratio' in the file name report ratio to the reference/bridge channel in each plex if specified, or a ratio to the average abundance within each plex (virtual reference approach). Files containing 'abundance' are generated by converting ratio tables back to the intensity (ion abundance) scale.

### global.profile.tsv
##### `global.profile.tsv` reports the most prominent features from [PTM-Shepherd](https://ptmshepherd.nesvilab.org/) analysis of mass shifts observed from FDR-filtered open search results. Each row corresponds to a different detected mass shift, thus **not all PSMs will be represented in this table**. Please note that mass shifts are annotated based on UniMod mapping, thus they are not definitive chemical identities and should be used as a starting point along with localization and amino acid enrichment information. Unless otherwise indicated, values are summed from all datasets in the analysis. Column contents are listed below.

**peak_apex** apex of the detected delta mass peak (in Da)

**peak_lower** lower bound of the detected peak (Da), determined by precursor tolerance or the detection of an adjacent peak

**peak_upper** upper bound of the detected peak (Da), determined by precursor tolerance or the detection of an adjacent peak

**PSMs** the number of PSMs contained within the peak boundary (bin), reported for each dataset if multiple datasets are used as input

**peak_signal** relative measure of peak prominence/quality. In noisy regions of the delta mass histogram, values are penalized 

**percent_also_in_unmodified** the percentage of PSMs in this mass bin with a corresponding PSM in the unmodified bin

**mapped_mass_1** primary modification annotation derived from [Unimod](https://www.unimod.org/modifications_list.php), all isobaric modifications listed and separated by “/”

**mapped_mass_2** if the delta mass peak is a combination of two masses, a second modification annotation is listed here. As with mapped_mass_1, all isobaric modifications are listed and separated by “/”

**similarity** MS/MS spectral similarity of modified peptides compared to their unmodified counterparts. When multiple modified-unmodified comparisons are done for a single peptide, these cosine similarity scores are averaged for the peptide. The peptide scores are then averaged across all peptides in the mass shift bin. These comparisons are only done for peptides of the same charge state.

**rt_shift** retention time shift comparing modified peptides to their unmodified counterparts. When multiple modified-unmodified comparisons are done for a single peptide, the retention time shifts are averaged for the peptide. The peptide shifts are then averaged across all peptides in the mass shift bin. Individual comparisons are only done for peptides in the same LC-MS run. Units are usually seconds but can vary by instrument type

**int_log2fc** log2 fold-change of average intensity for matched shifted/unshifted peptides, computed as described above. Peptides affect by sample preparation artifacts tend to be lower abundance than their unshifted counterparts, thus this value will be low in these cases

**localized_PSMs** number of PSMs for this delta mass that showed at least one additional matched ion when the mass shift is placed on a residue

**n-term_localization_rate** percentage of PSMs with an uninterrupted string of localized residues from the N-terminus. This is calculated differently from other enrichment scores due to the difference in assumptions underlying N-terminal and residue-specific localization, so these values cannot be directly compared to the amino acid enrichment scores.

**AA1** amino acid/residue most enriched (most likely to harbor the mass shift) compared to other residues

**AA1_enrichment_score** equivalent to the odds the delta mass is localized to AA1 compared to other residues

**AA1_psm_count** weighted number of PSMs where the mass shift localized to AA1. Shifts localizing to multiple residues are divided by the number of localized residues in the spectra, so this is an estimated number of PSMs localized to a particular residue

(same **enrichment_score**, and **psm_count** columns for **AA2** and **AA3** if multiple amino acids are likely to harbor the mass shift)

**[experiment]\_PSMs** number of PSMs with a mass shift in this bin

**[experiment]\_percent_PSMs** number of PSMs from the previous column as a percentage of total PSMs

**[experiment]\_peptides** number of unique peptide sequences with a mass shift in this bin

**[experiment]\_percent_also_in_unmodified** percentage of peptide sequences with a mass shift in this bin that are also found in the zero mass shift bin

### global.diagmine.tsv
#### `global.diagmine.tsv` is a mass shift-centric table that contains the diagnostic features identified for every mass shift. Please note that only mass shifts with diagnostic features detected are reported in the table. Contents of each column are listed below.

**peak_apex** This field contains the apex of the detected MS1 peak (Da) present in the global.profile.tsv file from PTM-Shepherd.

**mod_annotation** This field contains the mass shift annotations present in the global.profile.tsv file from PTM-Shepherd. When a mass shift is found to be the combination of two mass shifts, the “Potential Modification 1” and “Potential Modification 2” columns are merged with a semicolon.

**type** This field can take one of several values. “diagnostic” refers to diagnostic ions, the ions that can be located directly in the spectrum. “peptide” refers to peptide remainder masses, mass shifts that indicate an ion’s presence at a particular distance from an unshifted peptide. Six other values are possible based on parameter setting, each corresponding to one of the major ion series.

**mass** This field contains the mass of the diagnostic feature. Peptide and fragment remainder masses will have the mass shift away from the theoretical ion. Diagnostic ions will have the m/z of the observed ion, so a non-neutral mass.

**delta_mod_mass** This field contains the mass that was lost from the original mass shift to arrive at the remainder mass. (Note: only present for peptide and fragment remainder masses.)

**remainder_propensity** This field contains the average percentage of ions from a particular series that are shifted. For example, a peptide capable of producing 10 b-ions with 2 ions identified ions shifted by the remainder mass and 2 identified ions unshifted would have a propensity of 50%. The propensity score for every representative PSM within a mass shift bin is averaged. (Note: only present for fragment remainder masses.)

**percent_mod** This field contains the percentage of representative mass shifted PSMs that contain the ion at any intensity.

**percent_unmod** This field contains the percentage of representative unshifted PSMs that contain the ion at any intensity.

**avg_intensity_mod** This field contains the average intensity of the ion among representative mass shifted PSMs where the ion is present. To calculate the average across all representative mass shifted spectra, calculate (avg_intensity_mod * percent_mod / 100). Because multiple ions can be matched for fragment remainder ions, this contains the average of the summed intensity of matched ions for each representative PSM.

**avg_intensity_unmod** This field contains the average intensity of the ions among representative unshifted PSMs where the ion is present. To calculate the average across all representative mass shifted spectra, calculate (avg_intensity_mod * percent_mod / 100). Because multiple ions can be matched for fragment remainder ions, this contains the average of the summed intensity of matched ions for each representative PSM.

**intensity_fold_change** This field contains the fold change in intensity when comparing the modified to unmodified peptides. This uses intensity across all spectra and can be calculated via (avg_intensity_mod * percent_mod) / (avg_intensity_unmod * percent_unmod).

***avg_charge*** This field contains the average charge of peptides from the mass shift. This enables researchers to to use diagnostic ion information intelligently in designing targeted MS routines or rescoring.

**auc** This column contains the AUC-ROC statistic for the intensity-based classification of this ion. It is calculated from the U statistic from the Mann-Whitney U Test. This statistic adjusts the two groups such that they are assumed to be of equal size.

### global.modsummary.tsv
##### `global.modsummary.tsv` is a modification-centric table generated from [PTM-Shepherd](https://ptmshepherd.nesvilab.org/) summarization of mass shifts observed in open search workflows. Please note that mass shifts are annotated based on UniMod mapping, thus they are not definitive chemical identities and should be used as a starting point along with localization and amino acid enrichment information. Contents of each column are listed below.

**Modification** Name/annotation of the modification (as found in the global.profile.tsv file)

**Theoretical Mass Shift** The theoretical mass (in Da) of the modification from [Unimod](https://www.unimod.org/modifications_list.php) if annotated, or the peak apex of an unannotated modification

**[experiment]\_PSMs** Number of PSMs with the modification, including any row from the global.profile.tsv file where the modification appears (e.g., a 'Methylation' entry in the will include PSMs corresponding to both 'Methylation' and 'Methylation + First isotopic peak')

**[experiment]\_percent_PSMs** The number of PSMs from the previous column as a percentage of the total PSMs
