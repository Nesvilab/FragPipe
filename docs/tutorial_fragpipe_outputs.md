### Guide to FragPipe results

Output files will depend on the [workflow](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/docs/tutorial_fragpipe_workflows.html) used and how experiments/groups are set on the 'Workflow' tab. This page lists the different output files generated by FragPipe. Main report files are either comma-separated (csv) or tab-separated (tsv), and their column contents are described here. Outputs that take the name of the input LC-MS file are shown with the generic 'filename' placeholder here.

Log files are saved automatically (with a timestamp) if an analysis finishes successfully, but they can also be exported (with the 'Export Log' button on the 'Run' tab) to help with troubleshooting if an analysis fails.

FragPipe also uses various configuration and intermediate files listed here.

Also see our [guide to using FragPipe](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/docs/tutorial_fragpipe.html).

#### TMT/iTRAQ reports
Isobaric labeling reports are found in the 'tmt-report' folder. Two sets of isobaric labeling quantification reports are generated by [TMT-Integrator](https://tmt-integrator.nesvilab.org/), one set with abundances and one with ratios. Files containing 'ratio' in the file name report ratio to the reference/bridge channel in each plex if specified, or a ratio to the average abundance within each plex (virtual reference approach. Files containing 'abundance' are generated by converting ratio tables back to the intensity (ion abundance) scale.

### global.profile.tsv
##### `global.profile.tsv` reports the most prominent features from [PTM-Shepherd](https://ptmshepherd.nesvilab.org/) analysis of mass shifts observed from FDR-filtered open search results. Each row corresponds to a different detected mass shift. Unless otherwise indicated, values are summed from all datasets in the analysis. Column contents are listed below.

**peak_apex** apex of the detected delta mass peak (in Da)

**peak_lower** lower bound of the detected peak (Da), determined by precursor tolerance or the detection of an adjacent peak

**peak_upper** upper bound of the detected peak (Da), determined by precursor tolerance or the detection of an adjacent peak

**PSMs** the number of PSMs contained within the peak boundary (bin), reported for each dataset if multiple datasets are used as input

**peak_signal** relative measure of peak prominence/quality. In noisy regions of the delta mass histogram, values are penalized 

**percent_also_in_unmodified** the percentage of PSMs in this mass bin with a corresponding PSM in the unmodified bin

**mapped_mass_1** primary modification annotation derived from [Unimod](https://www.unimod.org/modifications_list.php), all isobaric modifications listed and separated by “/”

**mapped_mass_2** if the delta mass peak is a combination of two masses, a second modification annotation is listed here. As with mapped_mass_1, all isobaric modifications are listed and separated by “/”

**similarity** MS/MS spectral similarity of modified peptides compared to their unmodified counterparts. When multiple modified-unmodified comparisons are done for a single peptide, these cosine similarity scores are averaged for the peptide. The peptide scores are then averaged across all peptides in the mass shift bin. These comparisons are only done for peptides of the same charge state.

**rt_shift** retention time shift comparing modified peptides to their unmodified counterparts. When multiple modified-unmodified comparisons are done for a single peptide, the retention time shifts are averaged for the peptide. The peptide shifts are then averaged across all peptides in the mass shift bin. Individual comparisons are only done for peptides in the same LC-MS run. Units are usually seconds but can vary by instrument type

**localized_PSMs** number of PSMs for this delta mass that showed at least one additional matched ion when the mass shift is placed on a residue

**n-term_localization_rate** percentage of PSMs with an uninterrupted string of localized residues from the N-terminus. This is calculated differently from other enrichment scores due to the difference in assumptions underlying N-terminal and residue-specific localization, so these values cannot be directly compared to the amino acid enrichment scores.

**AA1** amino acid/residue most enriched (most likely to harbor the mass shift) compared to other residues

**AA1_enrichment_score** equivalent to the odds the delta mass is localized to AA1 compared to other residues

**AA1_psm_count** weighted number of PSMs where the mass shift localized to AA1. Shifts localizing to multiple residues are divided by the number of localized residues in the spectra, so this is an estimated number of PSMs localized to a particular residue

(same **enrichment_score**, and **psm_count** columns for **AA2** and **AA3** if multiple amino acids are likely to harbor the mass shift)

**[experiment]\_PSMs** number of PSMs with a mass shift in this bin

**[experiment]\_percent_PSMs** number of PSMs from the previous column as a percentage of total PSMs

**[experiment]\_peptides** number of unique peptide sequences with a mass shift in this bin

**ReferenceIntensity** real reference channel abundance if one has been provided, otherwise these values are virtual reference abundances from the average abundance across the channels, more information [here](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/docs/tutorial_tmt.html#quantification-settings)

**[sample/channel name]** normalized and log2 transformed abundance/ratio for the given reporter ion channel from summarization to the stripped peptide sequence level
<br>
<br>
<br>

### multi-site
##### `Report_[abundance/ratio]_groupby=multi-site_protNorm=[MD]_gu=[0].tsv` contains isobaric quantification information summarized from the psm.tsv tables by [TMT-Integrator](https://tmt-integrator.nesvilab.org/) based on modification sites that have been observed and quantified together. If 'Group by' is set to 'Multiple PTM sites' in the 'Quant (Isobaric)' tab of FragPipe, only multi-site reports will be generated. Set 'Group by' to 'All' to generate reports at all levels. (Ratios are channel abundance / reference channel abundance, so [channel] - ReferenceIntensity in the tables since values are log2-transformed.)

**Index** protein name (FASTA sequence header) with the start and end positions of the potential modification sites within the protein sequence, the count of the possible sites in that sequence window, the count of localized modifications, and the list of modified sites

**Gene** originating gene name

**Peptide** stripped peptide sequence containing the modification sites, residues with localized modifications are shown in lower case

**MaxPepProb** highest PeptideProphet probability of the PSMs with the sequence that are used in quantification

**ReferenceIntensity** real reference channel abundance if one has been provided, otherwise these values are virtual reference abundances from the average abundance across the channels, more information [here](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/docs/tutorial_tmt.html#quantification-settings)

**[sample/channel name]** normalized and log2 transformed abundance/ratio for the given reporter ion channel from summarization to the multiple-mod site level
<br>
<br>
<br>

### single-site
##### `Report_[abundance/ratio]_groupby=single-site_protNorm=[MD]_gu=[0].tsv` contains isobaric quantification information summarized from the psm.tsv tables by [TMT-Integrator](https://tmt-integrator.nesvilab.org/) to the level of single post-translationally modified sites. If 'Group by' is set to 'Single PTM site' in the 'Quant (Isobaric)' tab of FragPipe, only multi-site reports will be generated. Set 'Group by' to 'All' to generate reports at all levels. (Ratios are channel abundance / reference channel abundance, so [channel] - ReferenceIntensity in the tables since values are log2-transformed.)

**Index** protein name (FASTA sequence header) with the modified site location within the protein sequence

**Gene** originating gene name

**Peptide** stripped peptide sequence containing the modification sites, residues with localized modifications are shown in lower case

**MaxPepProb** highest PeptideProphet probability of the PSMs with the sequence that are used in quantification

**ReferenceIntensity** real reference channel abundance if one has been provided, otherwise these values are virtual reference abundances from the average abundance across the channels, more information [here](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/docs/tutorial_tmt.html#quantification-settings)

**[sample/channel name]** normalized and log2 transformed abundance/ratio for the given reporter ion channel from summarization to the single modification site level (sites are quantified from PSMs with only the site of interest if available, otherwise the median of all localized sites is used if the site is only found with additional sites)
