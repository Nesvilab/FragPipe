Spectral library building with EasyPQP to generate a Spectronaut and DIA-NN compatible spectral library for subsequent quantification using those tools.
Default is RT alignment using commonly observed peptides (ciRT). Alternatively (recommended for non-human data), when building a library from narrow-window DIA runs, include one (or more) wide-window single-shot DIA runs, and choose "Automatic selection of a run as Reference' in EasyPQP. All runs will then be aligned to the reference wide-window DIA run.

##### Spectral library building from DDA (SpecLib)
Workflow for building spectral libraries using DDA data, or using pseudo-MS/MS spectra extracted with DIA-Umpire (or using both data types if building a combined DIA+DDA library). Closed search with MSFragger, peptide/protein validation and protein inference with PeptideProphet/ProteinProphet via Philosopher. Building a consensus spectral library with EasyPQP. The library is filtered to 1% FDR at the protein and peptide levels. If using fractionated DDA data, in EasyPQP choose RT Calibration option: "ciRT" (choose iRT if using organisms other than yeast or human). If using DDA data together with DIA-Umpire extracted mzML files, choose RT Calibration option: "Automatic selection of a run as reference RT". Supports DDA RAW/.d files, mzML, and MGF files. Generated library.tsv file is directly compatible with DIA-NN and Spectronaut for targeted extraction of quantitative information.
