##### Default
Simple closed search, no quantification. MSFragger search with 'stricttrypsin' (Trypsin/P) enzyme, fully tryptic peptides only, up to 2 missed cleavages. Met oxidation and protein N-term Acetyl specified as variable modifications, and C+57 as fixed modification. Deisotoping, mass calibration, and parameter optimization are enabled. Post-processing with Philosopher (PeptideProphet, ProteinProphet), with 1% FDR filtering at the PSM and protein levels (sequential filtering).
<br>

##### DIA_SpecLib_Quant
Complete workflow for DIA analysis using spectral library building and quantification using DIA-NN. Spectral library can be built from DDA data and/or DIA data, with direct identification from DIA data using MSFragger-DIA. All data are processed together using MSFragger (in DDA or DIA mode, respectively) - MSBooster - Percolator - ProteinProphet (Philosopher) - EasyPQP. The library is filtered to 1% FDR at the protein and peptide levels. DIA files annotated as 'DIA-Quant' are used for quantification only (i.e. not used for spectral library building). If building the library from fractionated DDA data only, in EasyPQP tab change RT Calibration option to "ciRT", or "iRT" if using organisms other than yeast or human (requires iRT peptides). Supports DDA RAW/.d files, mzML, and MGF files. DIA files with staggered windows should be mzML files demultiplexed using Proteowizard. For quantification using DIA-NN, Thermo/Sciex DIA files should be in mzML format, and .d for Bruker's timsTOF. diaPASEF DIA data will only be used for quantification (i.e. automatically considered as 'DIA-Quant' data type).

##### DIA_DIA-Umpire_SpecLib_Quant
Alternative workflow for DIA analysis using spectral library building and quantification using DIA-NN. This is an alternative to the main DIA_SpecLib_Quant workflow in that DIA data (files annotated as \u2018DIA\u2019 type) are first converted to pseudo-MS/MS spectra using DIA-Umpire, followed by conventional MSFragger (DDA mode) search.Spectral library can be built from DIA (via DIA-Umpire) and optionally DDA data. All data (DDA and pseudo-MS/MS spectra from DIA) are processed together using MSFragger - MSBooster - Percolator - ProteinProphet (Philosopher) - EasyPQP. The library is filtered to 1% FDR at the protein and peptide levels. Supports Thermo and Sciex data only. For spectral library building both RAW and mzML files are supported, however, quantification with DIA-NN requires mzML files.
<br>

##### Nonspecific-HLA-DIA-Astral

Deep learning-based rescoring of MSFragger results with MSBooster, followed by PSM validation with Percolator. Protein inference is performed with ProteinProphet but protein FDR filter is not applied, so each output file (PSM, ion, peptide) is filtered to 1% FDR at that level.
