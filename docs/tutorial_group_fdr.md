## Perform group FDR estimation for different identification groups

##### [FragPipe](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org) can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Nesvilab/FragPipe/releases). Follow the instructions on that same Releases page to launch the program. See [here](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/docs/tutorial_fragpipe.html#configure-fragpipe) for help configuring FragPipe.

FragPipe can perform a group FDR estimation to calculate FDRs for each group separately. Then groups can be the number of enzymatic termini (_i.e._ 0, 1, 2), the protein evidence levels encoded in the FASTA file, and modifications.


### Use the number of enzymatic termini or the protein evidence levels to group the PSMs

The group FDR approach supports most workflows. After loading a specific workflow, go to the MSFragger tab to select the group type.

Then, go to the `Validation` tab, and add `--group` to the `FDR Filter and Report` command box.

The rest of the part is the same as that in a normal FragPipe analysis.

To make FragPipe recognize the encoded protein evidence, the protein header in the FASTA file must have the `PE=` keyword. The numbers after `PE=` identify different groups. [Here](https://github.com/bassanilab/CircRNA_MS_ref_fasta) has a handy script to revise the protein headers.


### Use the modifications to group the PSMs

In `MSFragger` tab, set the `Group variable` to `None`.

Go to the `FDR Filter and Report` panel in the `Validation` tab, add the modifications you want to group using the `--mods` flag. The following is an example.

Philosopher will create 3 groups: unmodified peptides, peptides with the specified modifications only, and all other modifications. In the above example, the specified modifications are oxidation and protein N-term acetylation. Then, FDR will be computed separately for 3 groups: unmodified, specified common modifications, and rare modifications that are not specified.
