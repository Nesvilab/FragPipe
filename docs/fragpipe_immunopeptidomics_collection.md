Immunopeptidomics analysis comparing MHC class I–bound peptides isolated from melanoma cells and their secreted melanosomes. Eluted peptides were analyzed by LC–MS/MS using MSFragger within FragPipe with non-enzymatic search parameters and peptide-level FDR control. FragPipe-based processing enabled side-by-side characterization of cellular and melanosomal immunopeptidomes, showing extensive overlap in peptide repertoires, detection of tumor-associated antigens, and identification of a small number of mutation-derived neoantigens on melanosomes. These immunopeptidomics results were combined with proteomic profiling and TCR sequencing to assess how melanosome-associated HLA–peptide complexes interact with CD8⁺ T cells.

Immunopeptidomics study examining interferon-γ– and tryptophan-depletion–induced changes in the MHC class I peptide repertoire of cancer cells. HLA class I–bound peptides were isolated from multiple cancer cell lines and analyzed by LC–MS/MS, with data processed using MSFragger within FragPipe against a combined wild-type and W→F-substitutant peptide database. FragPipe-based non-enzymatic searches with peptide-level FDR control enabled systematic identification of hundreds of W→F neoepitopes, primarily restricted to HLA-A*24:02. The resulting immunopeptidomics data were used to define shared, inducible neoepitopes and to support downstream functional evaluation of T cell recognition and adoptive T cell therapy models.

Hansen, A.H.; Lorentzen, L.G.; Leeming, D.J.; Sand, J.M.B.; Hägglund, P.; Davies, M.J.; *Analytical Biochemistry*. 2025.  
[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2025.115837](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2025.115837)

Method-focused study establishing a combined peptidomics and proteomics workflow for secretome analysis of precision-cut lung slices. LC–MS/MS DDA-PASEF data were processed using MSFragger within FragPipe to support unspecific (peptidomic) and semi-specific (proteomic) database searches against the rat UniProt reference proteome. FragPipe was configured with broad peptide length and mass ranges to enable identification of endogenous peptides lacking defined enzymatic termini, alongside conventional proteolytic peptides, with 1% PSM-level FDR control. IonQuant was used for MS1-based intensity extraction with match-between-runs enabled, allowing quantitative comparison across biological and technical replicates. The study demonstrates FragPipe’s suitability for large-search-space, non-tryptic peptide identification workflows relevant to immunopeptidomics-style analyses of naturally presented or secreted peptides.

Methodology-focused immunopeptidomics study evaluating EThcD fragmentation on the Orbitrap Excedion Pro across multiple HLA class I ligandomes. HLA-bound peptides from several cell lines were analyzed by LC–MS/MS using HCD and EThcD, with data processed using MSFragger within FragPipe under non-enzymatic digestion settings and peptide-level FDR control. FragPipe-based analysis was used to compare identification rates, sequence coverage, and allele-specific biases between fragmentation modes, showing that EThcD increases sequence coverage and recovers subsets of immunopeptides that are less efficiently identified by HCD alone, including peptides with internal arginine residues and arginine methylation.

Study introducing RiboTIE, a transformer-based method for identifying translated open reading frames from ribosome profiling data, with orthogonal mass spectrometry validation. Proteomics data from medulloblastoma cell lines were analyzed using FragPipe with MSFragger under standard tryptic settings, with protein databases augmented by RiboTIE- and ORFquant-predicted non-canonical ORFs. FragPipe-based searching enabled detection of peptides supporting selected non-canonical ORFs and N-terminal extensions, providing independent MS evidence for a subset of RiboTIE-predicted translation events and supporting integration of ribosome profiling with proteomics for non-canonical proteome characterization.

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcpro.2025.101052](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcpro.2025.101052)

Systematic benchmarking study of mass spectrometry strategies for identifying and quantifying small proteins (<50 aa) in *Escherichia coli*. LC–MS/MS data from top–down and bottom–up workflows (DDA, DIA, PRM) were processed using MSFragger within FragPipe under non-specific and semi-specific digestion settings, with peptide- and protein-level FDR control. FragPipe-based analysis was used to compare data acquisition modes, sample preparation strategies, and database search configurations, showing strong performance for small-protein detection in DDA and DIA datasets and supporting open and proteogenomic searches. While not an immunopeptidomics study per se, the work is relevant to immunopeptidomics-style analyses due to its focus on short peptides, non-tryptic search spaces, and large-database searching.
