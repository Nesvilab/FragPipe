# Use peptide prediction models from Koina for MSBooster feature generation

[Koina](https://koina.proteomicsdb.org/) is a web server that allows users to get MS2, retention time (RT), and ion mobility (IM)
predictions from multiple machine and deep-learning models from the community. It can be tedious running each model 
separately due to differences in supported peptides, string formatting, and accessibility. Koina combats this by 
providing a central hub where all models can be queried in a similar fashion. 
[MSBooster]([Koina](https://koina.proteomicsdb.org/)) uses the Koina API to gain
access to these different models, some of which will outperform the FragPipe default of DIA-NN depending on the types of
data they were trained on. Below we demonstrate two different ways to use Koina, either by explicitly choosing a model
of your choice or by letting a heuristic best model search algorithm make that decision for you. 

## Example dataset: HLA

This tutorial uses one mzML file from [the HLA Ligand Atlas](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33858848/).
It has been searched by MSFragger, producing a pin file, a pepXML file, and a fragger.params file. All files can be
downloaded from the [Google Drive link here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1szQmsLD2d_lE3JAWcnRcLR8rcjiGqdHb?usp=sharing).
1. If you have not already, please download the [latest FragPipe](https://github.com/Nesvilab/FragPipe/releases).
Koina is available as of version 22.0.
2. Load your mzML file.

3. Load the "Nonspecific-HLA" workflow from the workflow tab. Then you can uncheck the MSFragger checkbox, only running
the steps in the validation tab. It should look like this.

4. Set your output directory in the run tab to the Koina_MSBooster_tutorial folder

### Running with the default DIA-NN model

The default prediction model for both MS2 spectra and RT in MSBooster is DIA-NN. If we run our workflow, we'll see
2615 peptides passed 1% PSM and peptide FDR cutoffs. This number may vary slightly based on differences in software versions


### Choosing a Koina model

We have our baseline performance at 2615 peptides with DIA-NN predictions. It is important to note that these peptides
were fragmented with CID instead of HCD. It is unclear whether DIA-NN was trained CID data or not. However, Prosit has
an explicit CID model. Let's swap in Prosit for DIA-NN.

Before using Koina, we must specify a Koina server URL. The publicly available one is 
`https://koina.wilhelmlab.org:443/v2/models/`. Copy-paste this into the text box, if you are ok with sending out predictions
to an external server. Don't worry, the peptides submitted for prediction are not stored by the server! If you are working
with confidential data, consider [setting up your own Koina server](https://github.com/wilhelm-lab/koina).

Next, use the dropdown menus to choose the Prosit models.

Run this workflow now, and we get 2818 peptides. 200 more IDs!

### Heuristic best model search

Let's say you don't know what models are best suited towards your data. There are some general guidelines you can follow
[here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.01.596953v1) based on our tests, but as more models get added
to Koina, the number of models to choose from may become overwhelming. To address this, we have implemented a "best model
heuristic search" algorithm that tries to find the model best suited for you data. You can activate it by checking the
`Find best ___ model` checkboxes. Both DIA-NN and Koina models will be considered.

Let's look at the log to see what's going on:
```
### RT model search

2024-08-05 15:29:00 [INFO] - RT model chosen is AlphaPept_rt_generic
```

In the RT model search, MSBooster takes 1000 high-quality PSMs to perform RT calibration. While the root mean squared 
error (RMSE) metric is shown, a "top consensus" method is used, described in more detail in our 
[paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.01.596953v1). That is to say, the model with lowest RMSE may not
be the one chosen. Still, RMSE is an informative metric to know the dispersion of predicted RTs. Prosit TMT has the 
largest RMSE, which is expected since we aren't working with TMT data. Ultimately, AlphaPeptDeep RT is chosen.

```

Here we see details of the best MS2 model search. As expected, Prosit CID performs the best, since it is the only CID
model currently Koina. Additionally, we see that the optimal normalized collision energy (NCE) for prediction is below 20%. 
This is something you can customize in the [MSBooster standalone version](https://github.com/Nesvilab/MSBooster/blob/master/Koina.md#command-line).

Ultimately, this further optimized model combination results in 2863 peptide IDs, ~50 peptides more than using Prosit's
RT model. Neat!

### Visualizing predictions in FragPipe-PDV

Starting from v1.2.1., [FragPipe-PDV](https://github.com/Nesvilab/FragPipe-PDV) can be used to visualize mirror plots of 
experimental vs predicted spectra for both DIA-NN and Koina models. The prediction file to load is determined by what 
model you ran last (printed in msbooster_params.txt). Koina predictions are saved in the file ending in `koina.mgf`. 
While DIA-NN does not predict y/b-1/2 ions, many of the Koina models do. Peep the y1 and y2 ions!

## Summary
MSBooster uses the Koina API to gain access to many more prediction models, leading to increased peptide IDs when there 
is a better model than DIA-NN. Please refer to the [MSBooster documentation](https://github.com/Nesvilab/MSBooster/blob/master/Koina.md)
for more details, such as what QC figures are generated when Koina is run.
