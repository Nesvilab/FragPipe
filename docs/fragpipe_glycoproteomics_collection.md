Structural glycoproteomics study defining how site-specific N- and O-glycosylation of soluble CD52 governs immunosuppressive activity via selective binding to the HMGB1 Box B domain. High-resolution LC–MS/MS with MSFragger/FragPipe glycoproteomics workflows enabled confident localization of a low-occupancy but functionally critical O-glycosylation site at Thr8 and detailed characterization of highly sialylated N-glycans. These experimentally defined glycoforms informed molecular dynamics simulations revealing atomistic glycan-mediated interactions underlying HMGB1 Box B specificity and downstream SIGLEC-10 engagement.
