The Hipparchus library is a library of mathematical components. It started as a fork of Apache Commons Math.

This is a maintenance release.

 It fixes a few bugs, mainly a serious one for complex eigendecomposition when several eigenvalues
 are equal. It also add sum and angle differences in SinCosand FieldSinCos.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o issues/104:  Fixed LU-decomposition issue with signed zero complex numbers on diagonal. 
o issues/99:   Fixed complex eigendecomposition when several eigenvalues are equals. 

Fixed Bugs:
o issues/106:  Added sum and difference of angles in SinCos and FieldSinCos. 
o issues/105:  Removed spurious reduction of BigFraction in equality test.
